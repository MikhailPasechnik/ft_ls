*TODO*:
- parsing
- flags
- sorting
- non list display 

Within your mandatory part you are allowed to use the following functions:

- write
- opendir
- readdir
- closedir
- stat
- lstat
- getpwuid
- getgrgid
- listxattr
- getxattr
- time
- ctime
- readlink
- malloc
- free
- perror
- strerror
- exit

You are allowed to use other functions to carry out the bonus part as long as their
use is justified during your defence. For example, to use tcgetattr is justified in
certain case, to use printf because you are lazy isnâ€™t. Be smart!
